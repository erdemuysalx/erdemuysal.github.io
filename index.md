# Hi, I am Erdem!

I am a researcher and engineer working on autonomous systems. My research focus is on advancing the frontiers of AI for autonomous intelligent systems, exploring how intelligent agents can perceive, reason, and act in complex and dynamic environments. My work spans the development of novel algorithms and architectures that enable machines to learn, adapt, and make decisions autonomously
